<p> <h6>Tips to Admin</h6>
Ecommerce laws are ideally created to protect customers and businesses alike. <br>
Some laws help prevent identity theft, mitigate fraud cases, and generally keep customer data private.<br>

And sometimes these laws are put in place to protect customers from businesses.<br>
For example, there are laws that prevent misleading and inaccurate advertising practices, as well as advertising to and collecting data from children.<br>
There are even laws that prevent businesses from processing unauthorized transactions, even if they have the consumerâ€™s payment information.<br>
